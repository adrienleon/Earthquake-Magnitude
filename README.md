# MATH 439 Final Exam Problem 2 - Adrien Leon

## Overview

This project contains the work and analysis for Problem 2 of the MATH 439 Final Exam, completed by Adrien Leon. It includes a detailed exploration of earthquake magnitudes dataset (`eqmag.csv`) and a script written in R (`MATH 439 Final Exam Problem 2 Adrien Leon.R`) for statistical analysis.

## Description

In this project, we perform statistical analysis on earthquake data to understand the distribution of earthquake magnitudes. The R script provided carries out various statistical tests and generates visualizations to aid in the interpretation of the data.

## Data

The `eqmag.csv` file is a CSV dataset that contains records of earthquake magnitudes. The structure of the data includes:
- Magnitude
- Date/Time of occurrence
- Geographical coordinates

## Installation

To run the R script, you will need an R environment such as RStudio. Ensure that you have the latest version of R and any necessary packages installed.

## Usage

To execute the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Load the R script in your R environment.
2. Read the CSV data into a dataframe.
3. Execute the script to perform the analysis and view the results.
